NCCTG Lung Cancer Data
Description

Survival in patients with advanced lung cancer from the North Central Cancer Treatment Group. Performance scores rate how well the patient can perform usual daily activities.


Format
inst:	Institution code
time:	Survival time in days
status:	censoring status 1=censored, 2=dead
age:	Age in years
sex:	Male=1 Female=2
ph.ecog:	ECOG performance score (0=good 5=dead)
ph.karno:	Karnofsky performance score (bad=0-good=100) rated by physician
pat.karno:	Karnofsky performance score as rated by patient
meal.cal:	Calories consumed at meals
wt.loss:	Weight loss in last six months

## Plotting Survival Curves

### Using Survival Package
```{r}
plot(survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = lung), 
     xlab = "Days", 
     ylab = "Overall survival probability")
```

### Using Survminer
```{r}
ggsurvplot(
    fit = survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = lung), 
    xlab = "Days", 
    ylab = "Overall survival probability")
```
## Simple Cox Regression Model

```{r}
res.cox <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = lung)
res.cox
```

```{r}
summary(res.cox)
```

## Multivariate Cox Regression Model

```{r}
res.cox <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ age + sex + ph.ecog, data =  lung)
summary(res.cox)
```
